# GD Explorer

GD Explorer is an asset explorer addon for Godot. It allows you to browse your asset library 
in a dedicated tab, prior to importing.

The image explorer currently supports .png and .jpg, but all supported Godot types will be coming
soon. 

Controls include: Zoom in/out, filtering options, tiling, modulation, and background options.

# Model Preview

Model Preview currently supports .gltf, .glb, but all supported Godot types will be supported soon.

3D camera controls are still in progress, but currently you can change the background env, and switch camera to ortho.

# Audio Preview

Audio Preview currently supports .wav, .ogg, but all supported godot types will be supported soon.

Controls include: Pause, play, restart, paning, looping, and a spectrum analyzer.

# Text Preview

You can also technically preview text files (e.g., markdown, text, licenses)

# Font Preview

Coming soon!

# Material Preview

This one will be much tricker, because there is so many differnt material types and such. Probably no support for now.
